# OpenAI Agent Authorized Security Testing

## Project Scope

This document authorizes a limited-scope security testing engagement specifically targeting the designated OpenAI Agent deployment. The goal of this testing is to identify potential vulnerabilities related to:

* **Prompt Injection Attacks**
* **Data Exfiltration Risks**
* **Agent Behavioral Exploits**
* **Unintended Data Exposure**

This assessment specifically targets interactions involving the OpenAI Agent and simulated external resources (such as test websites or controlled APIs) designed explicitly for this exercise.

## Testing Boundaries

Security testing activities must adhere strictly to the following boundaries:

1. **Authorized Assets Only**: Testing may only involve the specified OpenAI Agent instance provided explicitly for this engagement.
2. **No Production Data**: All data utilized or obtained during testing must be synthetic or fictional. Using real, personally identifiable, confidential, or sensitive user data is strictly prohibited.
3. **No Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attempts to disrupt service availability or impact performance significantly are strictly forbidden.
4. **Limited Interaction**: Testing interactions must remain within the provided test environment, including Vercel-hosted websites and OpenAI-controlled agent environments.

## Confirmation of Authorization

By participating in this security testing engagement, the undersigned confirms:

* Authorization to perform limited-scope security testing explicitly described herein.
* Understanding that any activities outside of the defined scope are strictly prohibited and unauthorized.
* Acknowledgment that this testing is exclusively for security research and vulnerability assessment purposes and is not intended to harm or disrupt services or users.

## Responsible Disclosure

All vulnerabilities identified must be reported immediately following the completion of the engagement. Participants agree to follow responsible disclosure practices by:

* Documenting vulnerabilities clearly and concisely.
* Not sharing findings publicly without explicit consent from OpenAI.
